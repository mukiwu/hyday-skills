description: Understand and navigate a Hyday vault — where notes, journal entries, templates, and assets live on disk. Use when working in a folder selected as a Hyday data root, when looking for the vault root, or when the user mentions Hyday folder, data path, vault, templates, or asks where notes are stored.

# Hyday Vault Layout Skill

A **Hyday vault** is just a folder on your computer. Hyday reads and writes plain `.md` files there — nothing is locked away in a database. This skill describes the folder convention so an agent can place, find, and rename files correctly.

## Step 0 — Locate the vault root (do this FIRST, every time)

Before reading or writing anything, you must know which folder on disk is the user's Hyday vault. **Read it from Hyday's config file** — don't guess and don't ask the user unless steps 1-3 below fail.

### Config file location

| OS | Path |
|----|------|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Hyday/settings.json` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Hyday\settings.json` |

The file is JSON. The vault root lives in the `journalPath` field:

```json
{
  "journalPath": "/Users/muki/Documents/MyNotes",
  "...": "other fields"
}
```

### Resolution order (try in sequence)

1. **Explicit override**: if the user typed a path in this conversation, or the env var `HYDAY_DATA_ROOT` is set, use that. Don't override.
2. **Read `settings.json`**: parse the JSON at the path above and read `journalPath`.
3. **Fallback to `~/.hyday-recovery`**: same JSON shape (`{ "journalPath": "..." }`). Hyday writes this as a backup when the user changes the path.
4. **Last resort: ask the user.** Do NOT assume `~/Documents/Hyday` or any default — Hyday has no default location.

### Sanity check after resolving

Verify the resolved path is actually a Hyday vault before any read/write:

- The directory exists.
- At least one of these is true:
  - A `journal/<year>/` subfolder exists (e.g. `journal/2026/`)
  - The root has loose `.md` files with YAML frontmatter (`title:`, `type:`, etc.)
  - A `templates/` or `.hyday/` subfolder exists at the root
- If none match, the resolved path is wrong (or Hyday has never been opened with this path) — bail and ask the user.

### Why this matters

Every other Hyday skill (`hyday-markdown`, `hyday-lifelog`, `hyday-whiteboard`) assumes you already know the vault root. If you skip Step 0 you'll either write files to the wrong directory or fail silently. The whiteboard MCP server uses the exact same resolution chain — keep your behavior consistent with it.

## Folder convention

```
<vault-root>/
├── journal/
│   ├── 2026/
│   │   ├── 2026-05-17.md
│   │   ├── 2026-05-16.md
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── 2025/
│   └── ...
├── templates/
│   ├── meeting.md
│   ├── weekly-review.md
│   └── ...
├── assets/
│   ├── images/
│   └── attachments/
├── reading-notes-atomic-habits.md
├── project-alpha.md
└── ...
```

### Folders explained

| Folder | Purpose | Hyday behavior |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| `journal/<year>/` | Daily journal entries | Files named `YYYY-MM-DD.md` are auto-typed as `journal` (see `hyday-lifelog`). |
| `templates/` | Note templates | Files here are surfaced in Hyday's "新增筆記 → 從範本" menu, not as regular notes. |
| `assets/` | Images and attachments | Not indexed as notes. Linked from notes via standard Markdown image syntax. |
| (root and subfolders) | Regular notes | Any `.md` file outside the above is indexed as a note. |

### Alternate journal layouts (also supported)

Hyday tolerates two older conventions if you inherited them:

- `<vault-root>/<YYYY>/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` — vault root *is* the journal folder (no `journal/` wrapper).
- `<vault-root>/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` — journal entries directly at the root (legacy, rare).

For new vaults, prefer `journal/<year>/<date>.md`.

## File naming

### Journal entries

- **Required form**: `YYYY-MM-DD.md` (e.g. `2026-05-17.md`). Hyphen separators.
- **Also accepted**: `YYYY.MM.DD.md` (e.g. `2026.05.17.md`). Dot separators.
- Filenames that look like dates but don't match these patterns are treated as regular notes.

### Regular notes

- Any descriptive filename ending in `.md`, e.g. `project-alpha.md`, `reading-notes-atomic-habits.md`.
- Avoid characters that are illegal in filenames on macOS/Windows: `/ \ : * ? " < > |`.
- Avoid filenames that look like dates (see above) unless you want the file to be a journal entry.
- Lowercase with hyphens is a safe default; Hyday displays the `title` from frontmatter, so the filename is only the on-disk identifier.

## What Hyday writes automatically

When you save a note from inside Hyday, the app maintains some on-disk state alongside your `.md` files. You'll see folders/files like:

| Path | Purpose | Should an agent touch it directly? |
|------|---------|---------------------------|
| `.notes-index/` | Index cache used for fast search and sort | **No** — Hyday regenerates this. |
| `.hyday/whiteboards-v2.json` | Whiteboard data (boards, items, connections) | **Not by hand.** Use the `hyday-whiteboard` MCP server (see `hyday-whiteboard` skill) — it handles backups and schema. |
| `.hyday/...` (other files) | Per-note app sidecars (table layouts, embeddings, etc.) | **No** — created automatically by Hyday. |
| `*.tlayout` | Per-note table layouts (legacy location) | **No**. |

**Rule of thumb**: only read and write the `.md` files (and files inside `assets/`). Sidecars under `.hyday/` are touched by Hyday or by the dedicated MCP servers — not by raw file edits.

## Workflow: Adding a new note from outside Hyday

1. **Decide the kind of file**:
   - Daily log? → `journal/<year>/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`, use `hyday-lifelog` marks.
   - Regular note? → `<vault-root>/<slug>.md` (or any subfolder under root that isn't reserved).
   - Template? → `templates/<slug>.md`.
2. **Use the right frontmatter** — see `hyday-markdown`. For journal files, frontmatter is usually empty or just `tags:`.
3. **Write the file** with the correct relative path and extension.
4. **Let Hyday pick it up** — usually within seconds when the app is open. The user doesn't need to restart.

## Workflow: Finding an existing note

1. Search by **title** first — Hyday's UI uses `title` from frontmatter as the display name, but the filename rarely matches.
2. If you only have a title, grep frontmatter:
   ```bash
   grep -l 'title: "Project Alpha"' <vault-root>/**/*.md
   ```
3. For journal entries, the filename IS the date — go straight to `journal/<year>/<date>.md`.

## Workflow: Renaming a note

- Renaming the **file** does not break backlinks if you keep the `title` the same — Hyday matches backlinks by title first.
- Renaming the **title in frontmatter** may break `[[title]]` style backlinks elsewhere. If you change a title, scan the vault for `[[old-title]]` and update.

## Validation checklist

After any vault operation:

1. New journal files are under `journal/<year>/` and named `YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
2. New regular notes have a `.md` extension and avoid date-shaped filenames.
3. Frontmatter is valid YAML wrapped in `---` (see `hyday-markdown`).
4. You haven't modified `.notes-index/`, `*.tlayout`, or other dotfiles.
5. Image references in notes point to files inside `assets/` (or external URLs).
